<p class="intro">My ideal are my <strong>Parents</strong>. Whatever I am now is only because of my parents. 
I want to become like my Father. He is very systematic person so I am. I love the way he observes everything and the most important thing he is very supportive and caring.
My mom has a very gentle and sweet behavior. She is very humble. I want to have that type of nature.</p>
